# Mean Standard

List of TMJP Engineering Rules

## Getting Started

To create a project, you need to install `generator-tmj-mean`. Check [here](https://github.com/TMJPEngineering/generator-tmj-mean) for details.

Once the setup is done, you will also need to create modules in your project. Check [here](https://github.com/TMJPEngineering/generator-tmj-module) for details.

## Features

These are the following features that I implemented in `generator-tmj-mean` and `generator-tmj-module`:

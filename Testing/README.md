# Testing Standard

List of TMJP Engineering rules &amp; standard workflow in Testing

## Getting Started

In agile, the developers will focus on Test Driven Developement (TDD). TDD is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code.

### Local

In **Laravel Framework**, we'll be using [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/). **PHPUnit** is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP.

In **TMJ Mean Stack** or any javascript application, we'll be using `karma` and `jasmine` together. **Karma** is a test runner for javascript. **Jasmine** is an open source testing framework for javascript.

### Pull Request

We'll be using CI (Continuous Integration) like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)

An example of CI:
